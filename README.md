## Personal projects   
### E-COMMERSE SHOP - [Live demo](https://e-commerce-sprint-4.netlify.app/)
<sup>RS School Final Project</sup>

Technologies Used: TypeScript. React, CSS, HTML, Vite. 

Description: Developed a comprehensive e-commerce platform replicating the real
shopping experience in a digital environment. Users can browse products, view details,add items to their cart, and view their cart seamlessly. Features include user login and
registration, product search, categorization, and sorting. The app uses CommerceTools, a
leading cloud-based commerce platform for B2C and B2B.

Team: Worked in a team of three over two months to design and implement the project.

My contribution: I integrated the CommerceTools API to enable dynamic product
management. In collaboration with the team, I customized layouts in Figma to align with
project requirements, enhancing the user interface and experience. I developed the user
profile page, allowing users to manage their account information effectively, and created an
intuitive cart page that facilitated easy product management, including adding and
removing items. Additionally, I implemented the React Context API for efficient state
management, ensuring smooth data flow throughout the application.
